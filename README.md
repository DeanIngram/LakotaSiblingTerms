## Cultural note

Lakota kinship and sibling terminology reflects cultural concepts that do not always map cleanly to English categories. This project is offered respectfully as a learning tool and may contain simplifications.

Sources consulted include published Lakota language materials and community-shared educational resources. Any errors are mine.

## Grammatical persons

Some terms vary depending on whether the speaker is a man or a woman. Some terms are common to both.

- **1st Person**: The term used when talking about one’s own (my) relative.  
- **2nd Person Singular**: The term used when talking about someone else’s (your) relative.  
- **3rd Person**: The term used when discussing his or her relative.
